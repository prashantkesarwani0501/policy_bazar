                <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Why PolicyBazaar?</h3>
                <p>PolicyBazaar represents an ideal target account for SquadStack's solutions. They're operating at massive scale with 86.9 million registered users, managing complex multi-channel sales operations across 17,100+ pin codes, and they've just achieved profitability after years of growth investment. This inflection point makes them particularly receptive to solutions that can optimize operations while maintaining their growth trajectory.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>1. Company Overview & Business Model</h2>
            
            <h3>The Foundation Story</h3>
            <p>Founded in 2008 by Yashish Dahiya, Alok Bansal, and Avaneesh Nirjar, PolicyBazaar emerged from a critical gap in India's insurance market. The traditional insurance buying experience was opaque, intimidating, and dominated by aggressive sales tactics. PolicyBazaar created India's first comprehensive insurance comparison platform, bringing transparency and choice to consumers.</p>

            <h3>How They Make Money</h3>
            <p>PolicyBazaar operates as a pure-play marketplace intermediary. They don't underwrite policies or bear insurance risk. Instead, they earn approximately 5.5% commission on every policy sold through their platform. This asset-light model has proven highly scalable.</p>

            <h2>2. Recent Developments & Strategic Initiatives (2024-2025)</h2>

            <h3>🏥 Major Move: Entry into Healthcare Delivery</h3>
            <div class="key-point">
                <p><strong>May 2025 Launch of PB Health:</strong> In a bold vertical integration move, PolicyBazaar raised $218 million to enter healthcare delivery. General Catalyst led with a $50 million investment. The company is investing ₹696 crores for approximately 33% ownership in this new venture.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Strategy:</strong> Build and operate 25-30 hospitals across 10 major Indian cities. The first facility is scheduled to open by December 2025.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Logic:</strong> By controlling healthcare delivery, PolicyBazaar aims to standardize claims processing, reduce friction between insurers and hospitals, and improve the overall customer experience. This vertical integration could fundamentally change how health insurance claims are handled in India.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>🌍 International Expansion - Reinsurance Services</h3>
            <p>In November 2025, PolicyBazaar launched technology-enabled reinsurance placement services in Sri Lanka, Qatar, Oman, and UAE. Co-founder Tarun Mathur is leading this initiative, which helps insurance companies in these markets execute reinsurance placements more efficiently using PolicyBazaar's technology platform.</p>

            <h3>💯 Customer Experience Innovation</h3>
            <div class="stat-box">
                <strong>April 2025 - "100% Claim Promise":</strong>
                <p style="margin-top: 10px;">PolicyBazaar guaranteed zero deductions on planned hospitalizations for select health policies from Bajaj Allianz, Niva Bupa, and ABHI. This bold customer commitment differentiates them in a market where claim rejections are a major pain point.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Digital Health Services:</strong> Integration of telemedicine and video health checks, initially accelerated by COVID-19, has now become a permanent feature set.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>💰 The Profitability Inflection Point</h3>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>This is critically important for our pitch:</strong> After years of growth-focused investment and operating losses, PolicyBazaar achieved profitability in FY 2025 with ₹353 crores in profit—a 448% increase year-over-year. They've now maintained profitability for 5 consecutive quarters.</p>
                
                <div class="stat-box" style="margin-top: 15px;">
                    <strong>Recent Financial Performance:</strong>
                    <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
                        <li>Q3 FY25: ₹72 crores profit</li>
                        <li>Q1 FY26: Revenue up 33%, profit up 347% YoY</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>However, their cost structure remains substantial:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Advertising spend: ₹1,360 crores annually</li>
                    <li>Employee costs: ₹1,540 crores annually</li>
                    <li>ESOP expenses: ₹540 crores annually</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Having just achieved profitability, the leadership team will be intensely focused on operational efficiency and cost optimization—without sacrificing growth or customer experience. This creates a perfect window for SquadStack's value proposition.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>👔 Leadership & Organizational Changes</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>February 2025:</strong> Santosh Agarwal moved from CEO of Life Insurance to CEO of PaisaBazaar, signaling increased focus on credit products</li>
                <li><strong>April 2025:</strong> Vivek Audichya promoted from PaisaBazaar CFO to PolicyBazaar CFO, bringing credit product expertise to the insurance side</li>
                <li><strong>Long-term commitment:</strong> Founders Yashish Dahiya and Alok Bansal re-appointed through 2031</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>7 Compelling Reasons Why PolicyBazaar Needs SquadStack</h2>

            <div class="value-prop">
                <h3>1. 🌊 Drowning in Lead Volume</h3>
                <p>PolicyBazaar generates millions of leads monthly across all product categories. The critical challenge: lead quality varies dramatically. Someone casually clicking an ad is fundamentally different from someone actively comparing three policies with purchase intent.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Current State:</strong> Likely using manual or basic lead scoring, resulting in telecallers wasting time on low-intent leads while high-intent prospects go cold.</p>
                
                <p><strong>SquadStack Solution:</strong> AI-powered lead scoring analyzes 40+ behavioral signals (time on site, pages viewed, quote requests, returning visitor, etc.) to prioritize calling efforts on leads most likely to convert. This dramatically improves agent productivity and conversion rates.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> 30-40% of leads that currently never get called (common industry problem) would receive timely outreach, directly impacting revenue.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="value-prop">
                <h3>2. 📈 Seasonal Demand Spikes Create Staffing Nightmares</h3>
                <p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Motor insurance renewals surge in March and September. Travel insurance spikes during Diwali, Christmas, and summer holidays. Health insurance sees renewal waves. These predictable but intense spikes create impossible staffing decisions.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Dilemma:</strong> Hire full-time staff for peak demand (who sit idle during troughs), or stay lean and let leads go cold during spikes. Neither option is acceptable.</p>
                
                <p><strong>SquadStack Solution:</strong> On-demand telecaller network scales capacity up or down in 3-4 days. Pay only for active calling hours. No hiring cycles, training overhead, or idle capacity costs.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Use Case:</strong> During March motor renewal season, scale up by 200% for 6 weeks, then scale back down. During Diwali travel insurance surge, add capacity for 3 weeks.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="value-prop">
                <h3>3. 🔄 Multi-Touch Journey Complexity</h3>
                <p>Nobody buys term life insurance on the first call. The typical customer journey involves 3-5 conversations across multiple channels over days or weeks. They need to compare policies, understand terms, discuss with family, and overcome objections.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> Managing this multi-touch orchestration across thousands of simultaneous customer journeys, ensuring no lead falls through the cracks, remembering context from previous calls, and knowing the optimal time and channel for the next touchpoint.</p>
                
                <p><strong>SquadStack Solution:</strong> Omnichannel engagement platform coordinates calls, WhatsApp, SMS, and email. AI determines the best time to call based on previous interaction patterns. Sentiment analysis from earlier calls informs the approach for the next conversation. Automated follow-up sequences ensure no lead goes cold.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="value-prop">
                <h3>4. 🎯 Quality Control at Scale</h3>
                <p>PolicyBazaar operates 77 physical centers plus distributed online operations. How do you ensure consistent quality when you have hundreds of telecallers across dozens of locations handling millions of calls?</p>
                
                <p><strong>Current Challenge:</strong> Manual call monitoring covers maybe 2-3% of calls. Inconsistent scripts, varying quality standards, no real-time coaching, and difficult root cause analysis when conversion rates drop.</p>
                
                <p><strong>SquadStack Solution:</strong> Every single call monitored across 23 quality parameters. Real-time sentiment analysis detects customer frustration. Automatic script compliance checking. AI-powered coaching identifies specific improvement areas for each telecaller. Dashboard shows quality trends across geographies, products, and campaigns.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Consistent customer experience regardless of which center handles the call. Faster identification of training needs. Reduced escalations and complaints.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="value-prop">
                <h3>5. 🌍 International Expansion Support</h3>
                <p>PolicyBazaar is actively expanding into UAE, Sri Lanka, Qatar, and Oman. Traditional approach: build local teams, establish local infrastructure, navigate local hiring. This is slow, expensive, and requires local expertise you might not have.</p>
                
                <p><strong>SquadStack Solution:</strong> Trained multilingual telecallers who can support regional markets. Voice AI supports regional dialects and languages. No need to establish local contact center infrastructure. Launch new market calling operations in days, not months.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Strategic Value:</strong> Accelerate international expansion timeline. Test new markets with minimal upfront investment. Scale up only after product-market fit is proven.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="value-prop">
                <h3>6. 💰 The Profitability Imperative</h3>
                <p><strong>Critical Context:</strong> PolicyBazaar just achieved profitability after years of losses. Board and investors are now watching every rupee. Employee costs of ₹1,540 crores are their second-largest expense after advertising.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The CFO's Dilemma:</strong> Must continue growing revenue while improving margins. Traditional approach of hiring more people to handle more volume is off the table.</p>
                
                <p><strong>SquadStack Value Proposition:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>3x cost savings</strong> compared to traditional in-house contact centers</li>
                    <li><strong>Variable cost model</strong> – pay only for actual calling hours, no fixed overhead</li>
                    <li><strong>90% connectivity rate</strong> vs. industry average of 40-50% (fewer wasted attempts)</li>
                    <li><strong>40% higher conversion rates</strong> through AI-optimized calling strategies</li>
                    <li><strong>Zero capex</strong> required – no infrastructure investment, no technology buildout</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>ROI Example:</strong> If SquadStack handles 30% of PolicyBazaar's calling volume at 60% lower cost with 40% better conversion, the impact on unit economics and bottom line is substantial – exactly what a newly profitable company needs to show investors.</p>

            <div class="value-prop">

                <h3>Decision-Making Unit (DMU) Analysis</h3>
                <p>PolicyBazaar's size and maturity mean any significant vendor decision involves multiple stakeholders. Based on organizational research, here are the key decision-makers and influencers:</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Primary Target: Operational Decision-Maker</h2>

            <div class="persona-card" style="border-top: 4px solid #764ba2;">
                <h3>🎯 PERSON #1: Sarbvir Singh</h3>
                <h4>Title: Chief Executive Officer (CEO) - PolicyBazaar</h4>
                <p><strong>LinkedIn:</strong> linkedin.com/in/sarbvir-singh</p>
                <p><strong>Likely Email:</strong> sarbvir.singh@policybazaar.com</p>
                
                <h4>Professional Background:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Appointed CEO of PolicyBazaar in <strong>February 2020</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>IIT Delhi</strong> graduate (Integrated Master's in Mathematics and Computer Applications)</li>
                    <li><strong>MBA from IIM Ahmedabad</strong></li>
                    <li>Former capital investor: Managing Partner at <strong>WaterBridge Capital</strong> and <strong>Capital18</strong> (Network18 group)</li>
                    <li>Also serves as President and Non-Executive Director at PB Fintech (parent company)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Why Sarbvir is THE Primary Target:</h4>
                <div class="key-point">
                    <p><strong>Operational Authority:</strong> As CEO of the operating business unit (not just group holding company), he owns P&L and operational efficiency decisions.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Profitability Mandate:</strong> He joined just before PolicyBazaar's profitability inflection. Cost optimization while maintaining growth is literally his core mandate.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Investor Mindset:</strong> His background in capital investing means he instinctively thinks in terms of ROI, unit economics, and scalable models – exactly how SquadStack should be positioned.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Change Agent:</strong> Joined in 2020, so he's relatively new to the organization (vs. founders who've been there since 2008). This makes him more receptive to modern solutions and operational improvements vs. "we've always done it this way" resistance.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Full Authority:</strong> Reports to founder Yashish Dahiya but has complete operational control. Can approve major vendor relationships without lengthy committee processes.</p>
                </div>

                <h4>His Daily Concerns:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>"How do I scale PolicyBazaar's operations to support PB Health and international expansion without blowing up our newly achieved profitability?"</li>
                    <li>"Employee costs are ₹1,540 crores – how do I get more productivity from this spend or find variable-cost alternatives?"</li>
                    <li>"The board wants sustained profitability AND 30%+ growth. How do I deliver both?"</li>
                    <li>"How do I maintain service quality across 77 centers while keeping costs under control?"</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Decision Power: VERY HIGH</strong> – Can approve major vendor contracts, has full operational authority</p>
                <p><strong>Targeting Priority: PRIMARY</strong> – Start here, this is the decision-maker</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Secondary Target: Technical Influencer</h2>

            <div class="persona-card" style="border-top: 4px solid #667eea;">
                <h3>💻 PERSON #2: Saurabh Tiwari</h3>

                <p><strong>Likely Email:</strong> saurabh.tiwari@policybazaar.com</p>
                
                <h4>Professional Background:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Actually worked at PolicyBazaar <strong>twice</strong> (2010-2016, returned in 2019) – true believer in the mission</li>
                    <li><strong>IIT Kanpur</strong> graduate (B.Tech), <strong>M.Tech from National University of Singapore</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Executive MBA from IIM Calcutta</strong></li>
                    <li>Founded his own company called <strong>Zphin</strong> in 2019 (digital transformation services), which was acquired by/merged into PB Fintech</li>
                    <li>Previously worked at IBM India and GEP Solutions</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Why Saurabh Matters:</h4>
                <div class="value-prop">
                    <p><strong>Technical Gatekeeper:</strong> Any integration with SquadStack's API, data flows, or system architecture needs his team's sign-off and implementation support.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Budget Owner:</strong> Contact center technology (dialers, CRM integrations, analytics tools, QA systems) comes from his IT budget. He's motivated to consolidate tools and reduce vendor sprawl.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Innovation Advocate:</strong> His background (founded a digital transformation company!) strongly suggests he's receptive to modern SaaS solutions and platform thinking vs. legacy build-everything-in-house mindset.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Pain Point Awareness:</strong> He intimately understands the challenges of managing disparate contact center point solutions and the maintenance burden they create.</p>
                </div>

                <h4>His Daily Concerns:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>"My engineering team spends too much time maintaining contact center operations tech instead of building product features that drive revenue"</li>
                    <li>"We have 8-10 different tools in our calling stack – dialers, CRM, analytics, QA, workforce management. Integration is a nightmare"</li>
                    <li>"How do I give the business real-time visibility into calling operations without building custom dashboards?"</li>
                    <li>"Can I reduce our technology debt while supporting new ventures like PB Health?"</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Decision Power: HIGH</strong> for technology decisions, MEDIUM for operational tools (would collaborate with CEO/CBO)</p>
                <p><strong>Targeting Priority: SECONDARY</strong> – Technical influencer, need his buy-in for implementation</p>
            </div>

            <h2>Tertiary Target: Business Unit Champion</h2>

            <div class="persona-card" style="border-top: 4px solid #84fab0;">

                <ul>
                    <li>Original co-founder (joined 2008) – deep institutional knowledge and founder-level influence</li>
                    <li>Currently leading <strong>international reinsurance expansion</strong> (Sri Lanka, Qatar, Oman, UAE – launched November 2025)</li>
                    <li>Oversees <strong>B2B/corporate insurance vertical</strong> (different sales motion from retail)</li>
                    <li>Manages <strong>PB Partners</strong> platform (100,000+ agent network)</li>
                    <li>Deep relationships with insurance carriers and broker networks</li>

                <h4>Why Tarun is Strategically Important:</h4>
                <div class="value-prop">
                    <p><strong>International Expansion Lead:</strong> He's literally spearheading their UAE, Sri Lanka, Qatar, Oman launch RIGHT NOW. SquadStack solves a massive pain point for him – how to handle calling operations in new markets without building local teams.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>B2B Sales Expertise:</strong> Corporate/group insurance requires a consultative, multi-touch sales approach. SquadStack's enterprise calling capabilities and sophisticated lead nurturing align perfectly.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Agent Network Oversight:</strong> Managing 100,000+ agents in the PB Partners program requires lead generation, training support, and partner enablement – all areas where SquadStack's platform could add value.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Founder Influence:</strong> As an original co-founder, he has significant influence on strategic vendor decisions even if he doesn't have direct approval authority for company-wide initiatives.</p>
                </div>

                <h4>His Daily Concerns:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>"How do I scale our international operations in UAE, Sri Lanka, Qatar, and Oman without expensive local hiring?"</li>
                    <li>"Corporate insurance sales cycles are long and complex – how do I improve conversion without adding headcount?"</li>
                    <li>"The PB Partners agent network needs better lead support to be truly effective"</li>
                    <li>"Can I prove ROI on international expansion quickly enough to justify continued investment?"</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Decision Power: MEDIUM-HIGH</strong> for his business unit, can strongly advocate for company-wide adoption</p>
                <p><strong>Targeting Priority: TERTIARY</strong> – Business unit champion, especially valuable for international expansion use case</p>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Lead with Sarbvir (CEO):</strong> Direct outreach positioning SquadStack as a strategic partner for profitable scaling. Focus on operational efficiency, cost optimization, and supporting new ventures (PB Health, international).</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Parallel nurture of Saurabh (CTO):</strong> Technical content marketing, case studies on API integration, platform consolidation benefits. Position as a way to free up his engineering team.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Leverage Tarun (CBO) for specific use case:</strong> If international expansion or corporate insurance comes up as a priority, bring Tarun in as a champion for those specific applications.</li>
                    
                    <li><strong>Ideal scenario:</strong> Warm introduction to Sarbvir through mutual connections (SoftBank portfolio companies, IIT/IIM alumni networks, insurance industry contacts). Cold outreach is viable but warm intro is always better.</li>

                    Subject: Quick thought on scaling contact center ops at PolicyBazaar
                </div>

                <p>Hi Sarbvir Sir,</p>

                <p>Hope you're doing well! I came across the recent news about PolicyBazaar's profitability milestone (congrats on 5 straight quarters!) and figured I'd reach out since we work on exactly the challenge you're probably thinking about now.</p>

                <p>I'm with SquadStack.ai – we help companies like Angel One and Kotak Securities handle massive call volumes without the usual contact center headaches. Given what PolicyBazaar's dealing with (77 centers, 17K+ pin codes, seasonal spikes, plus the new PB Health venture and international expansion), thought there might be something worth exploring.</p>

                <p><strong>What made me think of you guys:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You've achieved profitability but costs are still significant (₹1,540 Cr in employee costs)</li>
                    <li>International expansion and PB Health mean you need scalable operations</li>
                    <li>Motor and travel insurance create calling spikes that are tough to staff for</li>
                    <li>Maintaining quality across 77 locations while keeping costs down can't be easy</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Three things we help with:</strong></p>

                <p><strong>1. Elastic capacity:</strong> We scaled Upstox during their crazy growth phase. When you get seasonal spikes (renewals, travel insurance during holidays), you don't need hiring cycles – just dial up capacity.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Quality at scale:</strong> AI monitors calls across 23 parameters + sentiment analysis. RedBus uses this to keep CX standards solid even when demand fluctuates wildly.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Cost efficiency:</strong> Most clients see 40-60% reduction vs in-house while getting better connectivity (90% vs industry average of 50%). Variable cost model means you only pay for what you use.</p>

                <p>Not suggesting we replace everything – more like specific use cases where on-demand capacity makes sense: PaisaBazaar lead qualification, policy renewals, supporting the new international markets (UAE, Sri Lanka, etc.), or even the PB Health patient outreach as that scales.</p>

                <p>Would 15 minutes make sense to chat? I can show you what we've done with similar insurance/fintech companies and we can figure out if there's a fit. No pressure if timing's not right.</p>

                <p>Cheers,<br>

                <p>I'll keep this short since I know you're busy scaling PolicyBazaar while maintaining the profitability you've achieved.</p>

                <p>I'm with SquadStack.ai – we help companies like Angel One and Kotak Securities handle massive call volumes without traditional contact center overhead.</p>

                <p><strong>Why I'm reaching out:</strong></p>

                <p>PolicyBazaar's current situation seems like a perfect fit for what we do:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>77 centers + online ops across 17K+ pin codes = operational complexity</li>
                    <li>Seasonal spikes (motor renewals, travel) = tough staffing challenges</li>
                    <li>International push (UAE, MEA, Sri Lanka) + PB Health = need for scalable ops</li>
                    <li>Recent profitability = every operational rupee matters more than ever</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>What we're good at:</strong></p>

                <p>Instead of typical BPO outsourcing, we've built a platform + trained telecaller network that scales on-demand:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>90% connectivity (vs 50% industry avg)</li>
                    <li>40% higher conversions through AI-optimized calling</li>
                    <li>3x cost savings vs traditional setups</li>
                    <li>Launch in 3-4 days (not weeks or months)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>RedBus uses us for seasonal demand. Upstox scaled their customer onboarding 3x faster. Angel One handles their trading account opening with us.</p>

                <p><strong>Honestly think we could help with:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>PaisaBazaar's 20 lakh monthly inquiries (lead scoring + qualification)</li>
                    <li>Seasonal renewal campaigns</li>
                    <li>International market operations (no local hiring needed)</li>
                    <li>PB Health patient outreach as that venture scales</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Would 15 minutes work for a quick call? I can show you:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>How we've solved similar challenges for insurance/lending companies</li>
                    <li>Specific use cases where we'd complement your operations (not replace!)</li>
                    <li>Rough ROI estimate based on your scale</li>
                </ol>

                <p>No pressure – just want to see if there's something valuable here. If not, totally cool and I won't push 😊</p>

                    <p>Quick follow-up from my earlier note. I know you're swamped, so I won't push.</p>
                    <p>Just wanted to share this case study on how RedBus handles 3x seasonal traffic spikes without adding permanent headcount – thought it might be relevant given PolicyBazaar's motor/travel insurance seasonality.</p>

                    <p>I know you're swamped with PB Health launch and international expansion. If contact center optimization isn't top priority right now, totally understand.</p>
                    <p>If it comes up later this year (maybe during Q4 planning season or when you're scaling PB Health patient operations), feel free to ping me.</p>
                    <p>Wishing you continued success with the profitability journey – what you've accomplished is genuinely impressive!</p>

            <h1>Strategic Summary & Recommendations</h1>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h2>Why PolicyBazaar is an Ideal Target Account</h2>
                <p>PolicyBazaar represents a uniquely compelling opportunity for SquadStack based on six strategic factors:</p>
            </div>

            <div class="value-prop">
                <h3>1. 📈 Scale & Complexity</h3>
                <p>86.9M registered users, 17,100+ pin codes, 77 physical centers, multiple product categories with different sales motions. This operational complexity is exactly what SquadStack solves.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="value-prop">
                <h3>2. 💰 Profitability Inflection Point</h3>
                <p>Just achieved profitability after years of losses. Leadership is intensely focused on operational efficiency and cost optimization WITHOUT sacrificing growth. This is SquadStack's sweet spot.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="value-prop">
                <h3>3. 🚀 Growth Initiatives Requiring Scalability</h3>
                <p>PB Health launching December 2025, international expansion (UAE, Sri Lanka, Qatar, Oman), B2B corporate insurance growth – all need scalable calling operations without proportional cost increases.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="value-prop">
                <h3>4. 🌊 Seasonal Demand Volatility</h3>
                <p>Motor insurance renewals spike in March/September, travel insurance during holidays, health insurance renewal waves. Traditional hiring cycles can't handle this variability efficiently.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="value-prop">
                <h3>5. 🎯 Technology-Forward Culture</h3>
                <p>IIT/IIM leadership team that values data-driven decisions, API integrations, and modern SaaS solutions. SquadStack's technology platform aligns with their operating philosophy.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="value-prop">
                <h3>6. ✅ Proven Track Record with Peers</h3>
                <p>Angel One, Kotak Securities (direct competitors in fintech/insurance space) already use SquadStack successfully. This provides social proof and reduces perceived risk.</p>
            </div>

                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Target Sarbvir Singh (CEO)</strong> as primary decision-maker with multi-channel outreach (Email → LinkedIn → WhatsApp sequence)</li>
                    <li><strong>Parallel nurture of Saurabh Tiwari (CTO)</strong> with technical content (API docs, integration case studies, platform architecture)</li>
